If you want give it a try you need to start 3 q processes using the following lines:

C:\q\w32\q.exe qx.q -p 2009 
C:\q\w32\q.exe zia.q -p 2010 
C:\q\w32\q.exe user.q -p 2011

The first q process is there to act as an exchange. The implementation is inspired from the site gbkr.com.
The second one is the implementation of the  zero-intelligence model of agents.
The last one gives you the opportunity to interact with the exchange
